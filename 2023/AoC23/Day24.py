#If standing on a hail we will see the rock travel in a straight line,
#pass through us and two other points on two other pieces of hail that zip by
#there must be two vectors from our hail to the other two collisions (v1 and v2)
#such that v1 = m * v2 where m is some unknown scalar multiplier.
#we can make v1 = v2 by dividing one of the x,y or z components by itself to ensure
#it is equal to 1. Then solve.
